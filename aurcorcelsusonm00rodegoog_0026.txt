‘his friends} this may he attributed, without doubt, to the
modesty of that age, which encouraged superior talent hy its
admiration of geuim.

But sometimes bad results arise from good examples, so,
through the emulation cxcited in searching for the works of
great geniuses, the cupidity of librariam, fed hythe liberality

of princes, gradually increased until almost all the best au-
thors had undergone a change of title, nay, l may say, wera
adulterated without detection, hythe cupidity of each party
vying with another for the sake of gain.

But to return to Celsus: almost every edition of his
work now has s different title. That by Caesarius has
“Aurelii Cornelii Celsi de Re Medica Libri Vlll. erudi·
tissimi? All those published at Lyons and Leyden have

none of that encomiastic sanfaronade: they are more modest,

meh as Α. C. C. Ι). Μ. L. Vlll. The first of which Caius
changed into Aurelii Cornelii Celsi Romani de Re Me·

Cornelii Celsi Artium Liber Vl. Operis abeo Scripti :”
iu which. hs followed the authority of an ancient ma·
nuscript with the usual inscription on it. Neither has he
done this unadvisedly nor without foundation. As to the
word “ patris”, whether the author himself added it, or some
other person for him, it certainly does not want a pre-
edent among the examples of antiquity, especially among
the Greeks, whom Celsus made it a point to imitate, par·
ticularly Hippocrates of Cous, most of whose works he
rendered very elegantly into Latin. He himself testifies his
diligende in this ,kind of study,in a letter to Pullus Natalus,
far more correctly than that of Largus Designantianus, who in
a letter to his sons confesses himself to have been too free in
this affair.

In the same manner Carnarius remarhed in his dedication
to Marcellus, that he imitated Hippocrates for the most part
so close, that sometimes you may see whole periods of sen·
baeu described by the one, transcribed hythe other, nay,
whole chapter which relate nothing else than the opinions

. of Hippocrates verbatim. Therefore it was not without²
reason that Nic. Monardus called him the Ape of Hippo-
crates, in Venesection in Pleuritis. f. 8.

Although it may be true that the Latin autliorspl anfi*-
