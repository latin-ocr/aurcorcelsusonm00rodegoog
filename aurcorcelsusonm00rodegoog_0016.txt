PREFACE.

——————

Oua public Medical Functionaries have very judiciously re·
solved, that Celsus he prescribed as one of the tests by
which the Candidate is to be tried, and l am convinced that
this arises from the purest motivo, because it is supported by·
the most unquestionable authorities, both ancient and mov
dem, and by the laudable wish to exact from young gen·
tlemen destined for 'the medical profession amore respectable
and liberal education. The necessity of this enactment may
be very evident, since the daily improvement of all the col·
lateral branehes of medical science are every where making
progress. ,
¹ lt is now several years since Ι commenoed 'the Ordo¹
Verborum of this Work, for the express purpose of facilitating
the progress of gentlemen entering on the public service,
and l have every reason to believe that it was of no small
benefit to them, not only in lessening that taedium of study
otherwise necessary, but also in enabling them to compre-
hend the meaning of the Author more fully. The Text
copy which lhave followed, is that edited by the learned
and indefatigable Leonardus Targa, which is universally
allowed to be the most correct.

The great responsibility accruing on undertaking a Work
of so much labour rendered it a duty incumbent on me to be
in possession of every edition that l could possibly procure,
particularly those cum Notis Variorum. My principal object
inthis, was to present the reader with the most approved
textos the various, editors from Caesarius in the year 1528,
to that of Targa’s in 17693 since which no one has attempta.
