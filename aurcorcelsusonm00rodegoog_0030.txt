Rohertus Walturius indeed ranke Julius Celsus among
those who wroteon military affairs, arrd some evea ascribe
to him the Commentaries of Julius Caesam concerning which
there appears no reasonable argument.

That he was learned on many subjects there can be no
doubt: but that proves nothing, except that he was spru
from a respectable family, and born in an age most fruit
in¹ the productiori of great and learned men, an age indeed
whieh produced and reared the greatest men in literature,
philosophy, and eloquenco. Cicero, Sallust, Catullus, virgil,
Propertius, Horace, Tibullus, Manilius, Vitruvius, Antonius
Musa, Ovid, Livy, Scribonius Largus, Valerius Maximus,
Velleius Paterculus3 and if we extend his life to the reign ef
Claudius't'here were Quintus Curtius, Persius, Seneca, Si-
lius Italicus,¹ Pliny, all oi whom were men of the most corii
summata learning, 'the last of whom is considered by 'sorae
to be younger than Celsus. ·

That laudable custom among the ancients strengthens my
opinion, by which the three names of nobility, on the au·
thority of Pliny, were conferred on Celsus ; for we know they
were hardly ever allowed to freed men, except on some very
particular occasion, to whom the servile name always re·
matred. Nor do l doubt it, because in that letter which
Celsus wrote to Marcellus, the praenomen, by which the
Irmene alone were distinguished, was not inserted: at thp
commencemont of the work. For the name among reputed?
authors often includes the name and sumame. Haase
that epigram of Martial:

“ Ut jugalem curas, nornen utrumque bibam.''
