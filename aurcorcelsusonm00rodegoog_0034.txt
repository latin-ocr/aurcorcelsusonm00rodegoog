Hence Plaut ιιιιι ιιι his life of FemeliuS, the French Hip·
ρὀιιιι es, mentions him m the most complimentary manner,
not only'· ior the purity of his languag'c, but also for the so-

blamed with propriety3 let us add the opinion of Heurnius .

Therefore let that felicitous association, in youth, be united
to an unbiassed mind, and cultivate the elegance of his lan-
